A responsive SPA inspired by native applications. Bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Libraries and frameworks used

- react (to bring a _native_ feel to the website, to eliminate the need for page reloads, to make it easy to implement multiple languages)
- react-router (to be precise - HashRouter, to make routing work after page refresh)
- emailjs-com (sending emails directly from client-side code)
- focus-visible (a polyfill based on the proposed CSS pseudo-selector `:focus-visible`)
- formik (contact form validation)
- framer-motion (animations on route transitions)
- pure-react-carousel (highly custimizable carousel component)
- simplebar-react (custom scroll bar)
- styled-components (to learn the _css-in-js_ approach to styling)
- vanta.js (a 3D animated background)
- three.js (required by vanta.js)
